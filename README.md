#  Development of a multi-resolution fire season database on a global scale
The availability of quantitative and spatially explicit data on the seasonality of global-scale wildfires is essential for understanding and mitigating the negative impacts of forest fires on the environment, society, and economy. It constitutes a crucial piece of information for conducting numerous technical and scientific studies related to this phenomenon. However, as far as the author is aware, a global open-access database with explicit information on fire seasonality is not currently available. Therefore, the objective of this Master's Thesis is to contribute to the community by preparing a database suitable for this purpose, utilizing the tools provided by modern data science for accessing, manipulating, analyzing, and efficiently storing massive datasets, as well as making it openly accessible. Furthermore, the results are published at multiple resolutions after necessary geoprocessing operations, aiming to maximize their utility in various types of studies, and ensuring their free availability and reproducibility, in close adherence to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) that have guided this Master's Thesis in all its stages. As part of this work, an assessment of the validity and consistency of the generated databases is also conducted to provide a quantitative measure of their potential utility and to address any limitations that may arise from the necessary degradation of original data resolution in certain cases. Finally, the results are discussed, and a brief mention is made of ongoing tasks that could not be included in this Master's Thesis due to space constraints, as well as potential future avenues for improving and leveraging the produced data.
